## **Acoustic**

Two notes with fundamental frequencies in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class.

## **Theory**

### Music notation

**Music notation** or **musical notation** is any system used to visually represent aurally perceived music played with instruments or sung by the human voice through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols, including notation for durations of absence of sound such as rests.
It is a universal languages.

**Staff**

In Western musical notation, the **staff** (US) or **stave** (UK) is a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch or in the case of a percussion staff, different percussion instruments. Appropriate music symbols, depending on the intended effect, are placed on the staff according to their corresponding pitch or function. Musical notes are placed by pitch, percussion notes are placed by instrument, and rests and other symbols are placed by convention.

**Ledger line**

A **ledger line** is used in Western musical notation to notate pitches above or below the lines and spaces of the regular musical staff. A line slightly longer than the note head is drawn parallel to the staff, above or below, spaced at the same distance as the lines within the staff.

**Clef**

A **clef** (from French: clef 'key') is a musical symbol used to indicate which notes are represented by the lines and spaces on a musical stave. Placing a clef on a stave assigns a particular pitch to one of the five lines, which defines the pitches on the remaining lines and spaces.

The three clef symbols used in modern music notation are the G-clef, F-clef, and C-clef. Placing these clefs on a line fixes a reference note to that line.

Theoretically, any clef may be placed on any line. With five lines on the stave and three clefs, there are fifteen possibilities for clef placement. Six of these are redundant because they result in an identical assignment of the notes to the lines (and spaces). Thus, there are nine possible distinct clefs, all of which have been used historically.

In modern music, only four clefs are used regularly: treble clef, bass clef, alto clef, and tenor clef. Of these, the treble and bass clefs are by far the most common. The tenor clef is used for the upper register of several instruments that usually use bass clef (including cello, bassoon, and trombone), while the alto is mostly only used by the viola.

*Middle C represented on (from left to right) treble, alto, tenor and bass clefs.*

The use of different clefs makes it possible to write music for all instruments and voices, regardless of differences in range. Using different clefs for different instruments and voices allows each part to be written comfortably on a stave with a minimum of ledger lines. To this end, the G-clef is used for high parts, the C-clef for middle parts, and the F-clef for low parts.

A symmetry exists with middle C for the F, C and G clefs. Two mnemonics for learning the clef lines are:

This section shows a complete list of the clefs, along with a list of instruments and voice parts notated with them.

*G clefs*

    - Harp and keyboard instruments (upper stave of the grand stave). 
    - Cello, double bass, bassoon, trombone (high parts for bass-clef instruments). 
    - The viola (for very high notes). 
    - Soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto, contralto and tenor voices.

- French violin (no longer in common)
    - Violin and flute music in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

**Note**

A **note** is a symbol denoting the pitch and duration of a sound. A note can also represent a pitch class (set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart). 

The **naming convention**:

**Accidental**

An **accidental** is a note of a pitch (or pitch class) that is not a member of the scale. The sharp (♯), flat (♭), and natural (♮) symbols are also called accidentals. They had two different functionality:

* In **measure** (bar), raises or lowers the immediately following note (and any repetition of it in the bar) from its normal pitch, overriding the key signature. 

    !!! Warning
        N.B: Accidentals usually apply to all repetitions within the measure in which they appear, unless canceled by another accidental sign, or tied into the following measure.

* In **key signature**. a set of sharp (♯), flat (♭), or rarely, natural (♮) symbols placed on the staff define the tonality. In a key signature, a sharp or flat symbol on a line or space of the staff indicates that the note represented by that line or space is to be played a semitone higher (sharp) or lower (flat) than it would otherwise be played. This applies through the end of the piece or until another key signature is indicated.
