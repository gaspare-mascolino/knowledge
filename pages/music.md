## **Acoustic**

Two notes with fundamental frequencies in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same pitch class.

## **Harmony**

**Harmony** is the process by which the composition of individual sounds, or superpositions of sounds, is analysed by hearing. Usually, this means simultaneously occurring frequencies, pitches (tones, notes), or chords.

Its perception is based on consonance, pitch relationships are described as sounding more pleasant, euphonious, and beautiful than dissonant relationships which sound unpleasant, discordant, or rough.

The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and chord progressions and the principles of connection that govern them. It refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from melodic line, or the "horizontal" aspect.

Counterpoint, which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and polyphony, which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are therefore sometimes distinguished from harmony.
A dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. Harmonization usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between consonance and dissonance. Simply put, this occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.

**Scale**

A **scale** is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch. A scale ordered by increasing pitch is an ascending scale, and a scale ordered by decreasing pitch is a descending scale.

- **chromatic scale**: each scale step represents a semitone interval
- **diatonic scale**:
    - **major scale**: defined by the interval pattern W–W–H–W–W–W–H
    - **minor scale**: defined by the interval pattern W–H–W–W–H-W-W (the sensible is not present)
    - **harmonic minor scale**: defined as the minor scale except that the seventh degree is raised by one semitone, creating an augmented second between the sixth and seventh degrees (to fix the missing of the sensible).

    <center><img src="/images/music/harmonic-minor.png"></center>

    - **melodic minor scale**: defined as the minor scale except that the sixth degree is raised by one semitone in the ascending form of the scale (jazz minor), while the lowered seventh appears in the descending form of the scale (minor).

     <center><img src="/images/music/melodic-minor.png"></center>

- **pentatonic scale**: defined as the major scale without the IV (descending sensibile/leading tone) and VII grades (ascending sensibile/leading tone).

!!! Warning
    A scale is formed at least by 5 notes, otherwise it is a fragment of a scale.

The **modus** relates to the organisation of pitch in scales, start from a specific grade of the major scale.

|         |       Modes       |
| ------- | ----------------  |
|   I     |      Ionico       |  
|   II    |      Dorico       |  
|   III   |      Frigio       | 
|   IV    |      Lidio        |

|   VI    |      Eolio        | 
|   VI    |      Locrio       |

**Scale degree**

The scale degree is the position of a particular note on a scale relative to the tonic.

<center><img src="/images/music/degree.png"></center>

<center>

|         |          Degree          |                              |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
|   I     |          Tonica          |    (Strong or tonal degree)  |
|   II    |        Sopratonica       |                              |
|   III   |         Mediante         |                              |
|   IV    |       Sottodominante     |    (Strong or tonal degree)  |
|   V     |         Dominante        |    (Strong or tonal degree)  |
|   VI    |       Sopradominante     |                              |
|   VII   |        Sottotonica       |    (1W from the tonic)       |
|   VII   |         Sensibile        |    (1H from the tonic)       |

</center>

Three different group for classification of degrees:

1. Tonic group: I, III, VI
2. Subtonic group: II, IV
3. Dominant group: V, VII

Those chords may be substitute from each others. To keep up a song three are the foundamental degrees: I - IV - V, the others are collateral.

**Intervals**

An **interval** is the relationship between two separate musical pitches.

Two different kind:

- harmonic: notes are played simultaneously.
- melodic: notes are played in sequence.

The intervals in the major scale are:

<center>

|         |     Intervals     |
| ------- | ----------------  |
|   I     |     1a Perfect    |  
|   II    |     2a Major      |  
|   III   |     3a Major      | 
|   IV    |     4a Perfect    |  
|   V     |     5a Perfect    | 
|   VI    |     6a Major      | 
|   VI    |     7a Major      | 

</center>

Kind of intervals:

* **Major**
    * ♯ **Augmented**
    * ♯♯ **Doubly Augmented**
    * ♭ **Minor**
* **Minor**
    * ♯ **Major**
    * ♭ **Diminished**
    * ♭♭ ***Doubly Diminished**
* **Perfect**
    * ♯ **Augmented**
    * ♯♯ **Doubly Augmented**
    * ♭ **Diminished**
    * ♭♭ **Doubly Diminished**

!!! Note
    To identify intervals from the sixth onwards it is useful invert the interval keep in mind theese rules:

    - Perfect <-> Perfect
    - Major <-> Minor
    - Augmented <-> Diminished

Rules:

- II Minor = H
- II Major = W
- III Minor = W + H
- III Major = 2W
- IV Perfect = III Major (2W) + H
- V Perfect = III Major + III Minor
- V Diminished = 2 III Minor
- V Augmented = 2 III Major
- VI Minor = III Major inverted
- VI Major = III Minor inverted
- VII Minor = II Major inverted
- VII Major = II Minor Inverted

**Chords**

Chord, in music, is any harmonic set of pitches/frequencies consisting of multiple notes (also called "pitches") that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. For many practical and theoretical purposes, arpeggios and broken chords (in which the notes of the chord are sounded one after the other, rather than simultaneously), or sequences of chord tones, may also be considered as chords in the right musical context.

The most frequently encountered chords are triads, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: the root note, and intervals of a third and a fifth above the root note.

The symbols used for notating chords are:

- **m**, **min**, or **−** indicates a minor chord. The "m" must be lowercase to distinguish it from the "M" for major **(I - III Minor - V Perfect)**.
- **M**, **Ma**, **Maj**, **Δ**, or (**no symbol**) indicates a major chord. In a jazz context, this typically indicates that the player should use any suitable chord of a major quality, for example a major seventh chord or a 6/9 chord. In a lot of jazz styles, an unembellished major triad is rarely if ever played, but in a lead sheet the choice of which major quality chord to use is left to the performer **(I - III Major - V Perfect)**.
- **+** or **aug** indicates an augmented chord **(I - III Augmented - V Perfect)**.
- **o** or **dim** indicates a diminished chord, either a diminished triad or a diminished seventh chord (d is not used) **(I - III Minor - V Diminished)**.
- **ø** indicates a half-diminished seventh chord. In some fake books, the abbreviation m7(♭5) is used as an equivalent symbol **(I - III Minor - V Diminished - VII Minor)**.
- **2** is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g., add2, sus2) **(I - II Major - V Perfect)**.
- **3** is the minor or major quality of the chord and is rarely written as a number.
- **4** is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g., add4, sus4) **(I - IV Perfect - V Perfect)**.
- **5** is the (perfect) fifth of the chord and is only written as a number when altered (e.g., F7(♭5)). In guitar music, like rock, a "5" indicates a power chord, which consists of only the root and fifth, possibly with the root doubled an octave higher.
- **6** indicates a sixth chord. There are no rules if the 6 replaces the 5th or not.
- **7** indicates a dominant seventh chord. However, if Maj7, M7 or Δ7 is indicated, this is a major 7th chord (e.g., GM7 or FΔ7). Very rarely, also dom is used for dominant 7th.
- **9** indicates a ninth chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh as well, if it is a dominant chord.
- **11** indicates an eleventh chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh and ninth as well, if it is a dominant chord.
- **13** indicates a thirteenth chord, which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh, ninth and eleventh as well.
- **6/9** indicates a triad with the addition of the sixth and ninth.
- **sus4** (or simply 4) indicates a sus chord with the third omitted and the fourth used instead. Other notes may be added to a sus4 chord, indicated with the word "add" and the scale degree (e.g., Asus4(add9) or Asus4(add7)).
- **sus2** (or simply 2) indicates a sus chord with the third omitted and the second (which may also be called the ninth) used instead. As with "sus4", a "sus2" chord can have other scale degrees added (e.g., Asus2(add♭7) or Asus2(add4)).
- **(♭9)** (parenthesis) is used to indicate explicit chord alterations (e.g., A7(♭9)). The parenthesis is probably left from older days when jazz musicians weren't used to "altered chords". Albeit important, the parenthesis can be left unplayed (with no "musical harm").
add indicates that an additional interval number should be added to the chord. (e.g., C7add13 is a C 7th chord plus an added 13th).
- **alt** or **alt dom** indicates an altered dominant seventh chord (e.g., G7♯11).
- **omit5** (or simply **no5**) indicates that the (indicated) note should be omitted.

!!! Note
    Sus chords (because of there is no the third) creates instability, to give colour to a melody and to link chords with shared note.

**Harmony of the scales**

- **Major scale**: I Major - II Minor - III Minor - IV Major - V Major - VI Minor - VII Diminished
- **Harmonic Minor**: I Minor - II Diminished - III Augmented - IV Minor - V Major - VI Major - VII Diminished
- **Melody Minor**: I Minor - II Minor - III Augmented - IV Major - V Major - VI Diminished - VII Diminished

!!! Warning
    It could be useful use a chord in common between two different scales as "bridge" to change tonality.

**Principal cadences**

- **Perfect cadence**: V - I
- **Suspanded cadence**: I - V
- **Plagal (chiesastica) cadence**: IV - I
- **Half Plagal cadence**: I - IV

**Poliphony movements**

- **Direct**: parts move on the same direction
- **Oblique**: one part fixs and the other go up or down
- **Opposite**: one part goes up and the other down.
- **Mixed**: union of the previous three.

**Chords position**

1. **I position** (the octave sings): Bass - I and Violin III (Tenore) V (Alto) I (Soprano)
2. **II position** (the third sings): Bass - I and Violin V I III
3. **III position** (the fifth sings): Bass - I and Violin - I III V

The choose between one position from the other take the name of **voicing**.

**Inversion**
An inversion is a type of change to intervals, chords, voices (in counterpoint), and melodies. In each of these cases, "inversion" has a distinct but related meaning.

- Root position: Bass - I and Violin (whatever disposition).
- I inversion: Bass - III and Violin (creates an III - VI - VIII, it is call 6th chord) (It could be helpfull avoid thi inversion with vocal-third 'cause of weigh down the composition).
- II inversion: Bass - V and Violin (creates an IIII - VI - VIII, it is call 4th and 6th chord (4/6)) -> pre o post from the perfect chord.

!!! Note
    In the past to create a 7th it could be prepareted before, insert it on the previous chord.
    
## **Music notation**

**Music notation** or **musical notation** is any system used to visually represent aurally perceived music played with instruments or sung by the human voice through the use of written, printed, or otherwise-produced symbols, including notation for durations of absence of sound such as rests.
It is a universal languages.

**Staff**

In Western musical notation, the **staff** (US) or **stave** (UK) is a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch or in the case of a percussion staff, different percussion instruments. Appropriate music symbols, depending on the intended effect, are placed on the staff according to their corresponding pitch or function. Musical notes are placed by pitch, percussion notes are placed by instrument, and rests and other symbols are placed by convention.


<center><img src="/images/music/staff.png"></center>

**Ledger line**

A **ledger line** is used in Western musical notation to notate pitches above or below the lines and spaces of the regular musical staff. A line slightly longer than the note head is drawn parallel to the staff, above or below, spaced at the same distance as the lines within the staff.

<center><img src="/images/music/ledger-line.png"></center>

**Clef**

A **clef** (from French: clef 'key') is a musical symbol used to indicate which notes are represented by the lines and spaces on a musical stave. Placing a clef on a stave assigns a particular pitch to one of the five lines, which defines the pitches on the remaining lines and spaces.

The three clef symbols used in modern music notation are the G-clef, F-clef, and C-clef. Placing these clefs on a line fixes a reference note to that line.

<center><img src="/images/music/all-clefs.png"></center>
<center><img src="/images/music/piano-ranges.jpg"></center>


Theoretically, any clef may be placed on any line. With five lines on the stave and three clefs, there are fifteen possibilities for clef placement. Six of these are redundant because they result in an identical assignment of the notes to the lines (and spaces). Thus, there are nine possible distinct clefs, all of which have been used historically.

In modern music, only four clefs are used regularly: treble clef, bass clef, alto clef, and tenor clef. Of these, the treble and bass clefs are by far the most common. The tenor clef is used for the upper register of several instruments that usually use bass clef (including cello, bassoon, and trombone), while the alto is mostly only used by the viola.

<center><img src="/images/music/middle-c-in-four-clefs.png"></center>

*Middle C represented on (from left to right) treble, alto, tenor and bass clefs.*

The use of different clefs makes it possible to write music for all instruments and voices, regardless of differences in range. Using different clefs for different instruments and voices allows each part to be written comfortably on a stave with a minimum of ledger lines. To this end, the G-clef is used for high parts, the C-clef for middle parts, and the F-clef for low parts.

A symmetry exists with middle C for the F, C and G clefs. Two mnemonics for learning the clef lines are:

<center>**G**ood **B**oys **D**o **F**ine **A**lways, **E**very **G**ood **B**oy **D**oes **F**ine</center> 

<center><img src="/images/music/mnemonic-bass-alto-treble.png"></center>

<center>

|     Clef     |          Note            |                     Note Location                   |
| -----------  | ----------------------   | --------------------------------------------------- |
| G-clef       |      G<sub>4</sub>       |     on the line that passes through the curl        |
| C-clef       | C<sub>3</sub> (Middle C) |     on the line that passes through the centre      |
| F-clef       |      F<sub>3</sub>       |     on the line that passes between the two dots    |

The **percussion notation**:

<center><img src="/images/music/percussion-notation.png"></center>

The **chord chart**:

<center><img src="/images/music/chord-chart.png"></center>

It is intended primarily for a rhythm section (usually consisting of piano, guitar, drums and bass). In these genres the musicians are expected to be able to improvise the individual notes used for the chords (the "voicing") and the appropriate ornamentation, counter melody or bassline.

**Accidental**

An **accidental** is a note of a pitch (or pitch class) that is not a member of the scale. The sharp (♯), flat (♭), and natural (♮) symbols are also called accidentals. They had two different functionality:

* In **measure** (bar), raises or lowers the immediately following note (and any repetition of it in the bar) from its normal pitch, overriding the key signature. 

    !!! Warning
        N.B: Accidentals usually apply to all repetitions within the measure in which they appear, unless canceled by another accidental sign, or tied into the following measure.

* In **key signature**. a set of sharp (♯), flat (♭), or rarely, natural (♮) symbols placed on the staff define the tonality. In a key signature, a sharp or flat symbol on a line or space of the staff indicates that the note represented by that line or space is to be played a semitone higher (sharp) or lower (flat) than it would otherwise be played. This applies through the end of the piece or until another key signature is indicated.

!!! Symbols
    - ♯ sharp -> raises the note of a semitone.
    - ♯♯ (or X) double sharp -> raises the note of a tone.
    - ♭ flat -> lower the note of a semitone.
    - ♭♭ double flat -> lower the note of a tone.
    - ♮ natural -> restore the original sound.

**Time signatures**

The **time signature** (also known as meter signature, metre signature, or measure signature) is a notational convention used in Western musical notation to specify how many beats (pulses) are contained in each measure (bar), and which note value is equivalent to a beat.

In a music score, the time signature appears at the beginning as a time symbol or stacked numerals, immediately following the key signature (or immediately following the clef symbol if the key signature is empty). A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a barline, indicates a change of meter.

There are various types of time signatures:

- **simple**: consist of two numerals, one stacked above the other. The lower numeral indicates the note value that represents one beat (the beat unit), this number is typically a power of 2. The upper numeral indicates how many such beats constitute a bar.

- **compound**: subdivisions (which are what the upper number represents in these meters) of the beat are in three equal parts, so that a dotted note (half again longer than a regular note) becomes the beat.

<center><img src="/images/music/meters.jpg"></center>
    
- **complex**: signatures that do not fit the usual duple or triple categories are called complex, asymmetric, irregular, unusual, or odd—though these are broad terms, and usually a more specific description is appropriate. The term odd meter, however, sometimes describes time signatures in which the upper number is simply odd rather than even.

- **mixed**: While time signatures usually express a regular pattern of beat stresses continuing through a piece (or at least a section), sometimes composers place a different time signature at the beginning of each bar, resulting in music with an extremely irregular rhythmic feel. In this case, the time signatures are an aid to the performers and not necessarily an indication of meter.

- **additive**: to indicate more complex patterns of stresses, such as additive rhythms, more complex time signatures can be used. Additive meters have a pattern of beats that subdivide into smaller, irregular groups. Such meters are sometimes called imperfect, in contrast to perfect meters, in which the bar is first divided into equal units.

- **irrational**: Irrational time signatures (rarely, "non-dyadic time signatures") are used for so-called irrational bar lengths,that have a denominator that is not a power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.).

**Note value**

A **note value** indicates the relative duration of a note, using the texture or shape of the notehead, the presence or absence of a stem, and the presence or absence of flags/beams/hooks/tails. Unmodified note values are fractional powers of two.

<center><img src="/images/music/parts-of-a-note.png"></center>

A **rest** indicates a silence of an equivalent duration.

<center><img src="/images/music/note-and-rest-value.png"></center>

**Tuplet**

A **tuplet** (also irrational rhythm or groupings, artificial division or groupings, abnormal divisions, irregular rhythm, gruppetto, extra-metric groupings, or, rarely, contrametric rhythm) is "any rhythm that involves dividing the beat into a different number of equal subdivisions from that usually permitted by the time-signature (e.g., triplets, duplets, etc.)

The most common type of tuplet is the triplet.

- triplet -> Is an irregular group representing three notes played in a unit of time, usually when the rhythm is binary. Odds structure inside a even value.

- doublet -> Is an irregular group representing two notes played in a unit of time, usually when the rhythm is ternary. Even structure inside a odds value.

**Dottet note**

A **dotted note** is a note with a small dot written after it. In modern practice, the first dot increases the duration of the basic note by half (the original note with an extra beam) of its original value. This means that a dotted note is equivalent to writing the basic note tied to a note of half the value.

<center><img src="/images/music/dotted-notes.png"></center>

**Tie**

A **tie** is a curved line connecting the heads of two notes of the same pitch, indicating that they are to be played as a single note with a duration equal to the sum of the individual notes' values.

<center><img src="/images/music/tie.png"></center>

**Legato**

A legato indicates that musical notes are played or sung smoothly and connected. That is, the player makes a transition from note to note with no intervening silence.

<center><img src="/images/music/legato.png"></center>
