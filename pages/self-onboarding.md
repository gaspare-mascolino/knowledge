# What do we mean with self onboarding?

With self on-boarding we mean the possibility to use part of DevOps capabilities/tooling/tech-stack also if your application is not in the list of [official onborded applications](supported-apps.md).  
The support for the self-onboarding features is at **priority 2** respect to the [officially onboarded apps](supported-apps.md).
