Ne-Yo - So Sick

Capo: 6


[Intro]
 Am        F        C           G


[Verse 1]
                Am        F        C
Gotta change my answering machine
            G
Now that I'm alone
           Am            F     C
Cuz right now it says that we
                  G
Can't come to the phone
    Am              F         C
And I know it makes no sense
                      G
Cuz you walked out the door
        Dm11/F (1 X X 0 0-1 X)
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
 

Am             F
(it's ridiculous)
          C
It's been months
             G
And for some reason I just
 Am             F
(can't get over us)
C                     G
And I'm stronger then this
 Am             F
(enough is enough)
C
No more walkin round
    G
With my head down
Am           F
I'm so over being blue
C          G
Cryin over you
 
 

[Chorus]
    Am             F
And I'm so sick of love songs
C           G
So tired of tears
Am           F       C              G
So done with wishing you were still here
     Am             F              C          G
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
    Dm11/F (1 X X 0 0-1)
So why can't I turn off the radio?
 

 
[Verse 2]
       Am                 F
Gotta fix that calender I have
       C              G
That's marked July 15th
   Am                        F
Because since there's no more you
      C                 G
There's no more anniversary
       Am                 F
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
       C              G
And your memory
   Am                        F
And how every song reminds me
       C              G
Of what used to be
 


[Chorus] 
    Am             F
And I'm so sick of love songs
C           G
So tired of tears
Am           F       C              G
So done with wishing you were still here
     Am             F              C          G
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
Dm11/F (1 X X 0 0-1)
So why can't I turn off the radio?
 
 

[Bridge]
Em              Am
(Leave me alone)

Leave me alone
Em              Am
(Stupid love songs)
Em              Am
Don't make me think about her smile
F
Or having my first child
C
Let it go
G
Turning off the radio
 
 

[Chorus] (x3)
    Am             F
And I'm so sick of love songs
C           G
So tired of tears
Am           F       C              G
So done with wishing you were still here
     Am             F              C          G
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
Dm11/F (1 X X 0 0-1)
So why can't I turn off the radio?
 
 

[Outro]
    Am             F
Why can't I turn off the radio?

(why can't I turn off the radio?)
C
Why can't I turn off the radio?
